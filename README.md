# Bridging Tech Contributions

This repository showcases my contributions as a backend developer for Bridging Tech, a nonprofit focused on educational equity through technology. I was part of a small backend team and collaborated closely with frontend developers and designers to improve our internal database system and enhance app functionality.

  - Assessed and restructured the schema to reduce data redundancy and support scalability

  - Implemented input validation, password hashing, and error handling

- **Frontend Support**
